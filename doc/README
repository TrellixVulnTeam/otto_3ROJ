= Otto - GUI application testing tool in LXC =

Otto is a tool for functional testing of GUI application on hardware using LXC
containers.

  - Physical devices (graphics card, sound and input devices) are shared
    between the host and the container, so the container has access to the
    capabilities of the host like video acceleration.
  - There is no provisioning, it is replaced by simply mounting a squashfs
    from an iso image.
  - Boot time of the container is just a few seconds.
  - It runs on any hardware where the kernel supports LXC and an overlay FS
    (aufs, overlayfs)

The home page of the project is http://launchpad.net/otto

= Installation =

On Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail) or newer release:
  * Install a default raring-server-amd64 image on a physical machine Install
  * bzr, python3-lxc and aufs-tools

    $ sudo apt-get install bzr --no-install-recommends $ sudo apt-get install
    python3-lxc aufs-tools

  * branch otto from launchpad

    $ bzr branch lp:otto $ cd otto

  * Try to run otto:
    $ sudo bin/otto --help

  * You'll need to run lxc-start unconfined to allow mounting /dev/loop0
  * during
    the pre-start hook

    $ sudo apparmor_parser -R /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.lxc-start $ sudo ln -s
    /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.lxc-start /etc/apparmor.d/disable/


= Running Otto =

  * Create the first container:
    
    $ sudo bin/otto create raring-auto

  * Test by copying one iso and start otto

    $ cd ..  
    $ mkdir iso 
    $ zsync http://releases.ubuntu.com/raring/ubuntu-13.04-server-amd64.iso.zsync 
    $ sudo bin/otto -d start raring-auto -i /home/ubuntu/iso/raring-desktop-amd64.iso

-> check that everything is started normally

    $ sudo bin/otto -d stop raring-auto $ sudo bin/otto -d start raring-auto

-> the same container should restart

(Note: if there is a black screen and the session doesn't start then run stop
and start again this is a bug we are investigating)

    $ sudo bin/otto -d stop raring-auto $ sudo bin/otto -d start raring-auto \
        -i /home/ubuntu/iso/raring-desktop-amd64.iso -C ./example/autopilot/

-> If packages failed to install the logs are located in
/var/log/upstart/packages.log
  
= Origin of the name =
This tool has originally been written to replace UTAH [1] to run autopilot [2]
tests of Ubuntu Unity and other stacks running with Unity. The name "Otto"
comes from the name of the autopilot in the 1980 satirical movie Airplane!
