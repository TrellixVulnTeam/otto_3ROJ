= Otto - GUI application testing tool in LXC =

Otto is a tool for functional testing of GUI application on hardware using LXC
containers.

  - Physical devices (graphics card, sound and input devices) are shared
    between the host and the container, so the container has access to the
    capabilities of the host like video acceleration.
  - There is no provisioning, it is replaced by simply mounting a squashfs
    from an iso image.
  - Boot time of the container is just a few seconds.
  - It runs on any hardware where the kernel supports LXC and an overlay FS
    (aufs, overlayfs)

The home page of the project is http://launchpad.net/otto

= Installation =

On Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail) or newer release:
  * Install a default raring-server-amd64 image on a physical machine 
  * Install bzr, python3-lxc and aufs-tools

    $ sudo apt-get install bzr --no-install-recommends
    $ sudo apt-get install python3-lxc aufs-tools

  * branch otto from launchpad

    $ bzr branch lp:otto
    $ cd otto

  * Try to run otto:
    $ sudo bin/otto --help

  * You'll need to run lxc-start unconfined to allow mounting /dev/loop0 
    during the pre-start hook

    $ sudo apparmor_parser -R /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.lxc-start
    $ sudo ln -s /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.lxc-start /etc/apparmor.d/disable/

  * On Ubuntu swap resource control is enable in the kernel but disabled by
    default. To enable it make sure CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP_ENABLED=Y is set in kernel
    configuration file and swapaccount=1 on the kernel boot parameters (set it
    permanently in /etc/default/grub then run update-grub)

  * You may also want to install apport to enable crash reporting from
    applications inside the container.

== Integration with Jenkins ==
  * Declare the node jenkins server (use the same name than hostname by
    default)
  * install jenkins-slave
    $ sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends jenkins-slave
  * Add user 'jenkins' to /etc/sudoers
  * Edit jenkins-slave configuration in /etc/default/jenkins-slave and set the
    URL of the server. You can also set the name of the slave if you do not
    want to use the default (hostname)
  * Then start the slave
    $ sudo start jenkins-slave
  * Verify that the node becomes online on the server.
  * Follow the steps described in the previous section (Installation) as user
    'jenkins' instead of 'ubuntu'.

= Running Otto =

  * Test by copying an ISO of the latest development release or stable release

    $ mkdir ~/iso/ubuntu/; cd ~/iso/ubuntu/
    $ zsync http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/saucy-desktop-amd64.iso.zsync
    or
    $ zsync http://releases.ubuntu.com/raring/ubuntu-13.04-desktop-amd64.iso.zsync 

  * Create the first container:
    
    $ sudo bin/otto create saucy-otto ~/iso/ubuntu/saucy-desktop-amd64.iso

  * Start the container
    $ sudo bin/otto -d start saucy-otto

-> check that everything it started normally

    $ sudo bin/otto -d stop saucy-otto
    $ sudo bin/otto -d start saucy-otto

-> the same container should restart

(Note: if there is a black screen and the session doesn't start then run stop
and start again; this is a bug we are investigating)

    $ sudo bin/otto -d stop saucy-otto
    $ sudo bin/otto -d start raring-auto \
        -C ./example/autopilot/

-> If packages failed to install the logs are located in
/var/log/upstart/ottosetup.log

= Additional Notes =

* nVidia: By default nvidia uses nouveau. To install the proprietary driver
  from the package 'nvidia-current' you'll have to enable (or add if it doesn't
  exists) the component 'restricted' in /etc/apt/sources.list on the host and
  the guest
  
= Origin of the name =
This tool has originally been written to replace UTAH [1] to run autopilot [2]
tests of Ubuntu Unity and other stacks running with Unity. The name "Otto"
comes from the name of the autopilot in the 1980 satirical movie Airplane!
